```sh
sudo notify -intercept-biid                                    
Attempting to intercept BIID
BIID found, using: 123456789
```

# Config File
The default config file should be located in `$HOME/.config/notify/notify.conf` and has the following contents:

```yaml
burp_biid: 132465789
# Slack
slack: true
slack_webhook_url: https://a.b.c
slack_username: test
slack_channel: test

# Discord
discord: true
discord_webhook_url: https://a.b.c
discord_username: test
discord_avatar: https://a.b.c/avatar

# General Settings

    ```http
    {{request}}

    {{response}}
    ```

dns_message: |
    The collaborator server received a DNS lookup of type {{type}} for the domain name {{domain}} from {{from}} at {{time}}:

# Running notify

## CLI

You can use **notify** to receive burp collaborator interaction on your CLI, following command accepts `biid` as input and post all incoming interaction over CLI.

```sh
notify -biid 132456789                                  
```

## Slack notification

The tool accept parameters from a config file located at `$HOME/.config/notify/notify.conf` or either via CLI. 

To run the tool just use the following command.

```sh
â–¶ notify -biid 132456789 -slack -slack-webhook-url https://a.b.c -slack-username test -slack-channel test-channel
```

If you already configured the config file, you can simply run following command and `notify` will start receiving burp collaborator interaction on CLI and sends notification to slack / discord. 

```sh
â–¶ notify
```

## Discord notification

Similarly to slack, in order to use discord

```sh
â–¶ notify -biid 132456789 -discord -discord-webhook-url https://a.b.c -discord-username notify-bot
```

## Using notify with other tools

Notify also supports piping output of any tool and send it over discord/slack channel as notification.

Following command will enumerate subdomains using [SubFinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder) and probe for alive URLs and sends the notifications of alive URLs using [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx) to configured discord / slack channel.

```
subfinder -d hackerone.com | httpx | notify
```

<h1 align="left">
  <img src="static/notify-httpx.png" alt="notify-httpx" width="700px"></a>
  <br>
</h1>

Following command will enumerate subdomains using [SubFinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder) and probe alive URLs using [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx), runs [Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) templates and send the nuclei results as a notifications to configured discord / slack channel.


```
subfinder -d intigriti.com | httpx | nuclei -t files | notify
```

In similar manner, output (stdout) of any tool can be piped to **notify** for posting data into slack/discord. 


ðŸ“‹ Notes

- You can obtain the **biid** with wireshark on any platform and configure it within the config file.
- Burp collaborator server allow to fetch results only for once, so if you are using this, you will **not** see results in burp collaborator window.
- Config file has priority over CLI arguments.
